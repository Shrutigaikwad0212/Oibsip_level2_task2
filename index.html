                        <li><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>, in full <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</strong>, (born February 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal), Portuguese football (soccer) forward who was one of the greatest 
                            players of his generation.Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s name in honour of his
                            father’s favourite movie actor,Ronald Reagan, who was U.S. president at the time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a heart condition that necessitated surgery,
                            but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting
                            Lisbon),where he played for that club’s various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first team in 2002. A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable 
                            athlete on the pitch. Originally a right-winger,he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made 
                            sufficient space for openings in opposing defenses.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            After a successful season with Sporting that brought the young player to the attention of Europe’s biggest football clubs, Ronaldo signed
                            with English powerhouse Manchester United in 2003. He was an instant sensation and soon came to be regarded as one of the best forwards in the game. His finest season with United came in 2007
                            –08, when he scored 42 League and Cup goals and earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer, with 31 League goals. After helping United to a Champions League title in May 2008, 
                            <strong> Ronaldo captured Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year honours for his stellar 2007 – 08 season</strong>. He also led United to an appearance in the 2009 
                            Champions League final, which they lost to FC Barcelona.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soon thereafter Ronaldo was sold to Spain’s Real Madrid—a club with which he had long been rumoured to want to play—for a then record 
                            £80 million (about $131 million) transfer fee. His scoring prowess continued with his new team, and he netted the most goals (40) in La Liga history during the 
                            2010 – 11 season (his record was broken the following season by his rival Lionel Messi of Barcelona).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In 2011 – 12 Ronaldo helped Madrid capture a La Liga championship and scored a personal-best 46 goals during the League season.<strong> He 
                            scored a total of 66 goals in 56 appearances with Madrid and the Portuguese national team in 2013 to earn his second world player of the year award (the FIFA World Player of the Year was 
                            renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or in 2010)</strong>. In 2014 he scored 52 goals in 43 games and led Madrid to a Champions League title, which resulted in Ronaldo capturing another Ballon d’Or award. In 2014–15 
                            he netted 48 goals to lead La Liga in scoring. Ronaldo netted his 324th goal as a member of Real in October 2015 to become the club’s all-time leading goal scorer.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atlético at the Vicente Calderón, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of 
                            a 90-minute football match. His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league 
                            games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez. Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with 
                            a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions)
                            was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional,which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.
